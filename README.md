# python_chrome_extension
 Created simple chrome extension with help of  backend (compiler-api npm package) in order to fetch the result of the query, as pyiodide is being block by the CSP (Content Security Policy) because of too much restriction using for chrome extension, otherwise it will work for normal site. we can create functions and run them in the shell of the extension.
